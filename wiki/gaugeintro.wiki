This component allows you to display value changing information through virtual gauges.

It includes [gaugeGType several basic gauges] in different orientations and sizes. You can customize several basic elements in the gauges or create your own using i.e. Adobe Illustrator and by adding a simple inherited JavaFX class.

You can add highlighted ranges to the gauges or even replace completely their body and background, while you keep all the functionality of the component.
